<p>...has been involved in systems, middleware, and software runtime environments. He is working as a software engineer at <a href="https://www.treasuredata.com/">Treasure Data</a> since 2016, and contributing to <a href="https://www.embulk.org/">Embulk</a>, an open-sourced bulk data loader.</p>

<section id="introduction">
<p>Pluggable middleware architecture is my recent concern in engineering. Designing programming interface, especially for plugins, is always a difficult balancing problem between plugin's lifetime, programmability, and performance. Having good challenges on it through contributing to <a href="https://www.embulk.org/">Embulk</a> at <a href="https://www.treasuredata.com/">Treasure Data</a> in Tokyo, and experiences at <a href="https://www.ecrebo.com/">Ecrebo</a> in Reading, UK as a developer and a site reliability engineer.</p>
<p>Profiling memory usage had puzzled me for years both at <a href="https://www.research.ibm.com/labs/tokyo/"IBM Research - Tokyo</a> (f.k.a. Tokyo Research Laboratory; TRL) and <a href="https://about.google/locations/?region=asia-pacific&office=tokyo-rpg">Google Japan</a>. Started the efforts from <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1932682.1869477">Marusa project</a> at IBM Research to understand "real" memory usage in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenJ9">IBM's J9 Java VM</a> and hypervisors. Launched <a href="http://dev.chromium.org/developers/deep-memory-profiler">Deep Memory Profiler project</a> at Google then to dive into <a href="https://dev.chromium.org/">Chromium</a>'s more complicated memory usage.</p>
<p>Physical modeling have awoken my interests. Although I have no full-time experiences there so far, I was wondering if I could have chances to contribute to the area, especially in terms of fast (kinds of "super real-time") simulation of acausal models, for example written in Modelica.</p>
<p>Process migration techniques and system virtualization mechanisms had interested me in my when I was a student supervised by <a href="http://media.itc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/etsuya/"Prof. Shibayama</a> at <a href="http://www.is.c.titech.ac.jp/en/">Tokyo Institute of Technology</a>. Especially in interested in container-based virtualization such as FreeBSD jail and Linux-VServer back then. Received a B.Sc. in information science and a M.Sc. in mathematical and computing sciences from Tokyo Institute of Technology in 2004 and 2007, respectively.</p>
<p>Programming contests stole much of my college days. Participated in the <a href="https://icpc.global/">ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC)</a> for four years of my undergraduate, and took <a href="https://icpc.global/community/results-2003">the 21st place in World Finals 2003 (Beverly Hills)</a> and <a href="https://icpc.global/community/results-2004">the 28th place in 2004 (Prague)</a> with my powerful teammates. Co-founded the <a href="https://jag-icpc.org/">ACM-ICPC Japanese Alumni Group</a> then in 2004 to help younger contestants in practice contests and camps.</p>
